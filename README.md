## General Info
***
Our project is a LaTex converter, this means that we can convert every mathematical expression into a Latex code. This program allows the user to convert simple operation (Addition, Subtraction, etc.) and some more complex operation as Limit, Root and Power and then add results in a .tex file. In addition there's the possibility to add strings inside the .tex file that the user create.

## How to run the program
***
Open the terminal and digit these command lines
```
$ javac Main.java
$ Main.java
```
or

```
$ ./run.sh
```

## How it works
***
Once we start the program, a window will open where we will find the GUI of our project that will manage the user's requests and is divided into two parts: the input area, at the top, and the black background output area.
